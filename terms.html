                        <h2>1) Legally Binding Agreement:</h2>
                        <p> signing a contract with CleanWorx, you are signing a legally binding
                        contract for work to be completed at an agreed-upon price. In the event that
                        you break this contract, all deposits made to the company shall be
                        surrendered as damages.</p>
                        
                        <h2>2) Product Warranties:</h2>
                        All warranties are limited to those offered by the manufacturers of the
                        products used. CleanWorx makes no additional warranties. If you ever have a
                        concern regarding our work, CleanWorxshould be notified immediately.
                        
                        <h2>3) Water Usage:</h2>
                        
                        <p>By signing this agreement, you agree to provide CleanWorx the right to use
                        an on-site water supply as needed to complete the stated project without
                        compensation. If an exterior water supply is required, it will be at an additional
                        charge. It is the customerâ€™s responsibility to make sure the water supply is on
                        and in working order before we arrive. Additional charges will be applied if
                        water is not available.</p>
                        
                        <h2>4) Electrical Usage:</h2>
                        <p>By signing this agreement, you agree to provide CleanWorx the right to use
                        an on-site source of electricity as needed to complete the stated project
                        without compensation. If an exterior source is required it will be at an
                        additional charge.</p>
                        
                        <h2>5) Color and Tone Concerns:</h2>
                        <p>The properties and species of wood age and weather can greatly affect the
                        resulting color or tone of the stain. Note: Variances may occur on individual
                        boards as well as the total project, as densities and other characteristics vary
                        across and throughout the wood. CleanWorx and its associates attempt to
                        represent the final finish color and tones as best as possible. While we can
                        often give you an idea of the overall color or tone you must expect some
                        variance in the overall finish.</p>
                        
                        <h2>6) Courtesy:</h2>
                        <p>While CleanWorx is on location and performing work on your property, you
                        are responsible for keeping all children and pets, as well as other individuals
                        away from the work area. Children and pets must be kept off the work surface
                        for at least 24 hours after our work is completed. This is for your safety as well
                        as our own.</p>
                        
                        <h2>7) Payments:</h2>
                        
                        <p>Payments to CleanWorx are due as per the contract schedule and are to be
                        paid by check or cash. All balances are ALWAYS due upon completion of the
                        job. Any variance to this policy must be agreed upon and in writing on our
                        contract. Late charges will be immediately assessed on all balances not paid
                        in accordance with contract terms. The customer agrees to pay any collection
                        cost incurred by CleanWorx related to the collection process of outstanding
                        balances.</p>
                        
                        <h2>8) Scheduling:</h2>
                        <p>Scheduling in a business which productivity relies upon the weather can be
                        difficult. Inclement weather may affect scheduling. We try our best to keep
                        scheduling conflicts to a minimum, however, circumstances that are beyond
                        our control may affect your project start and completion dates. You will be
                        notified of any changes.</p>
                        
                        <h2>9) Removal & Replacement of Deck Contents:</h2>
                        <p>Removal and replacement of grills, deck furniture, planters and any other
                        items are the responsibility of the homeowner. Should we need to remove
                        items from the deck, we will not be responsible for any damage, breakage or
                        for storage issues. An additional charge may be applied for the time and labor
                        devoted to the removal of these items.</p>
                        
                        <h2>10) Damages:</h2>
                        <p>CleanWorx is not responsible for damages due to improperly installed siding,
                        loose shingles or siding, broken or opened windows, improperly sealed
                        windows and doors, wood rot, defective construction, improperly secured
                        wires, loose or improperly installed gutters, and leaders and improper
                        caulking. In every aluminum siding case and in some cases with vinyl siding,
                        the sun and weather will bleach the color or cause fading. Power washing,
                        which entails the removal of chalky, gritty, or failing surface materials may cause the faded aspects of the vinyl or aluminum to stand out. CleanWorx will
                        not be responsible for such conditions. CleanWorx will not be responsible for
                        loose mortar that may dislodge during the cleaning process.
                        
                        <h2>11) Stains:</h2>
                        <p>Some stains cannot be removed by power washing. Tree sap, artillery fungus,
                        splatters from stains and paints are examples of materials that cannot be
                        removed by conventional means. We make every attempt to point these areas
                        out to the customer when quoting the project. Sometimes these stains cannot
                        be removed at all.</p>
                        -
                        <h2>12) Watertight:</h2>
                        <p>CleanWorx Services expects your property to be in good repair and
                        weathertight. This includes, but is not limited to all electrical services including
                        receptacles and light fixtures. Doors and windows shall also be weathertight.
                        CleanWorx Services is not responsible for damages as a result of water
                        infiltration from poor or improper installation, maintenance, or repair of
                        electrical-related items or doors or windows. CleanWorx cannot guarantee
                        removal of artillery fungus from exterior house surfaces.</p>
                        
                        <h2>13) Window Spotting:</h2>
                        <p>Windows may become water spotted as a result of our services. Window
                        cleaning is NOT included.</p>
                        
                        <h2>14) Concrete:</h2>
                        <p>The appearance of concrete depends on a number of factors most linked to
                        when the concrete was initially poured and cured. When concrete with dirt,
                        mold, mildew, algae and other pollutants and stains is cleaned, the concrete
                        will then reveal any and all imperfections that the pollutants and stains have
                        covered up. The customer understands that not all concrete will look the same
                        even on the same driveway, patio, sidewalk, or concrete slab.</p>
